The language is the computer language *Python*. As compared to \"traditional\" languages taught in logic classes (predicate logic) or computer science classes (Java), this has a few advantages:\n",

        "1. The tools used to write and run Python code are freely available. When using Google Colab (as we are), you don't need to install anything on your computer.\n",

        "A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or playing a video.\n",

        "## Formal and natural languages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Natural languages** are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Programming languages are formal languages that are used to communicate with computers.**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several types of programmming languages. **Procedural languages** such as Python (as well as Java, Javascript, C, etc.) work by describing the step-by-step \"process\" you would like the comptuer to carry out. Things such as video games and computer applications are written in such languages. By constrast, **declarative languages** such as Structured Query Language (SQL, used to interact with databases) or Hypertext Markup Langauge (HTML, used to write webpages) work by \"telling\" (or \"declaring\") what kind of output you'd like, and leaving it up to computer how to prodce this. \n",
        "\n",
        "Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, $3 + 3 = 6$ is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but $3 += 3 \\$ 6$ is not. $H_{2}O$ is a syntactically correct chemical formula, but $_2Zz$ is not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. **Tokens** are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with $3  += 3 \\$ 6$ is that \\$ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, $_2Zz$ is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second type of syntax rule pertains to the structure of a statement; that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement $3 + = 3$ is illegal because even though + and = are legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called parsing.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when you hear the sentence, “The penny dropped,” you understand that “the penny” is the subject and “dropped” is the predicate. Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it means, or the semantics of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will understand the general implication of this sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics—there are some differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **ambiguity:**\n",
        "Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.\n",
        "\n",
        ">**redundancy:**\n",
        "In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **literalness:**\n",
        "Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny dropped,” there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone realized something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean exactly what they say.\n",
        "\n",
        "People who grow up speaking a natural language—everyone—often have a hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Poetry:**\n",
        "Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Prose:**\n",
        "The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Programs:**\n",
        "The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Formal languages are more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exercise 5: In a few sentences, tell me about any experience you've had with \"formal\" languages. If you think hard, I'll bet you've used at least one or two.**\n",

        "When programming computers (and really, when  working with any formal language), you should expect to make mistakes (lots and lots of mistakes...). This doesn't mean you are bad at it--it's just the nature of the beast. There are two basic \"types\" of errors that can occur:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax errors** occur when you violate the \"rules\" of the language. So for example, you want to print \"Hello\" to the screen in Python, but instead of typing *print(\"Hello\")*, you type *prit(\"Hello\")*. Python will respond by telling you (in essence) that it has no idea what you are taking about. It will give you an \"error message\" of some type. These error messages take some practice to understand. In some cases, Python will call them \"syntax errors\", but it might also call them \"name errors\" (meaning you've used a name it doesn't recognize), or \"runtime errors\" (meaning it didn't \"know\" this was a problem until the program was already running).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Semantic errors** occur when you follow the \"rules\" of the language, but you basically \"tell it to do the wrong thing.\" For example, let's suppose you want to print \"Hello!\" to a user, followed by their first name. (So, \"Hello, Brendan!\"). However, you decide to do this by typing print(\"Hello, [first name]\"). Python will do this, even though it wasn't you \"meant\". (Semantic = related to meaning).\n"
